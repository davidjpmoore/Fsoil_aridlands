# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for Fsoil_aridlands

## Scientific Context

This project studies **ecosystem and soil respiration responses to rainfall pulse events** in an arid grassland ecosystem at the **US-Wkg site** (Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona). The central hypothesis is that post-rain "pulse" periods disproportionately drive annual respiration, and that separate models for pulse vs. non-pulse conditions outperform a single lumped model.

- **Eddy covariance data**: US-Wkg AmeriFlux, half-hourly, 2012–2020 (gap-filled & flux-partitioned)
- **Chamber data**: 7-port automated soil respiration chambers (LI-COR), 2017–2020
- **Key fluxes**: NEE, GPP, RECO (eddy); Rsoil (chambers)
- **Key drivers**: SWC (5/15/30 cm), Tsoil (5/15/30 cm), precipitation (P)
- **Season definitions**: Winter = DOY 305–366 & 1–59; Spring = DOY 60–181; Summer = DOY 182–304

## Pulse Classification Logic

A "pulse event" is triggered by a rainfall day with sum > 5 mm:
- Rain > 5 mm → 8-day pulse window
- Rain > 10 mm → 14-day pulse window
- Rain > 20 mm → 20-day pulse window
- Overlapping windows take the **maximum** duration

Key columns: `sum_R` (daily precip mm), `max_pulse_duration`, `days_since_rain_event`, `PulseFlag` (1 = pulse, 0 = non-pulse)

2012 is excluded from publication figures due to sparse coverage.

---

## Core Respiration Model

The same nonlinear model is used for both RECO (eddy) and Rsoil (chamber):

```
R = Fref × ((GPP/GPPmax + n)/(1+n)) × (1 - c4×(0.1 - SWC)²) × exp(b4×T)
```

| Parameter | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `Fref` | Baseline respiration scale |
| `n` | Sets minimum when GPP=0: floor = `n/(1+n)`; ceiling = 1 when GPP=GPPmax |
| `c4` | Moisture parabola curvature; **optimum fixed at SWC=0.1**; positive = has optimum, negative = inverts shape |
| `b4` | Temperature sensitivity (exponential, not Q10) |
| `GPPmax` | Normalization scalar — **must always be the global max across all days** |

- SWC is always expressed as a **fraction [0–1]** in model fitting (convert if values > 1.5)
- Fitted using `nlsLM` (Levenberg-Marquardt) from `minpack.lm`. Helper `fit_nlsLM()` in `00_setup.R`.

### Model Variants

Four variants are fitted and compared in each script:

| Variant | Trained on | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **All** | All days | Lumped baseline |
| **NonPulse (NP)** | Dry/non-pulse days | Captures background respiration |
| **Pulse (P)** | Wet/pulse days | Captures post-rain response |
| **Switch/Threshold** | NP and P separately | Applies NP or P parameters depending on conditions |

### Two Classification Schemes (keep consistent within a script)

The pipeline uses **two different ways** to define "pulse" vs "non-pulse". They are correlated but not equivalent — a pulse-window day can dry out below 15% SWC, and a non-pulse day can retain residual moisture above 15%.

| Scheme | Definition | Used in |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Rainfall-event** | Within rainfall-triggered window (from `02_define_pulses.R`) | `08_read_chamber.R` splits; `07b`, `12_13`, `13`, `14` model fitting |
| **SWC-threshold** | `SWC ≥ 15%` (fraction ≥ 0.15) | `07` and `12` model fitting and switching |

**Rule**: the classification used for fitting must match the classification used for switching predictions. Do not mix them within a script.

---

## Scientific Rules — Never Violate

These rules encode scientific decisions made by the research team. They are not stylistic preferences. Any code edit that would violate one of these rules must be rejected or explicitly confirmed by the PI before proceeding.

1. **P-NP model uses rainfall-event classification exclusively.**
   Training data, prediction, and switch logic for the P-NP model must always use the rainfall-event criterion: `max_pulse_duration > 0` for pulse, `max_pulse_duration == 0` for non-pulse. Never substitute the SWC threshold for this model.

2. **15% threshold model uses SWC classification exclusively.**
   Training data, prediction, and switch logic for the threshold model must always use `meanSWC >= 0.15` (fraction). Never substitute rainfall-event labels for this model.

3. **The two classification schemes are scientifically distinct and never interchangeable.**
   The purpose of the study is to compare models built on rainfall-event vs SWC-threshold definitions. Mixing them within a script is a scientific error, not just a coding error.

4. **GPPmax must always be the global maximum from the full dataset.**
   Never compute GPPmax from a subset (e.g. pulse days only, non-pulse days only, a single year). Both fitting and prediction must use the same global GPPmax scalar.

5. **Cross-validation must refit the model inside the loop.**
   Any leave-one-year-out or other held-out CV must refit the model on training years only, then predict the held-out year. Never pass full-data predictions into a CV evaluation of a held-out period.

6. **The moisture term must never produce negative predictions.**
   The term `1 - c4*(0.1 - SWC)²` must remain non-negative across all observed SWC values. The upper bound on `c4` must be constrained to `1/(SWC_max_observed - 0.1)²`, or predictions must be clamped to ≥ 0 post-hoc.

7. **Study site and period are fixed.**
   The site is Walnut Gulch Kendall (US-Wkg), Sonoran Desert. The analysis period is 2012–2020 for eddy covariance and 2017–2020 for chamber measurements. Any changes to data filtering or date ranges must be explicitly confirmed by the PI before implementation.

8. **Do not upgrade R or install new packages without explicit instruction.**
   Figure-related packages (`ggrepel`, `ggpubr`) are not required for the analysis scripts (01–14). Do not install them as part of bug-fix work.

9. **Bug fixes and documentation changes must be in separate commits.**
   Never mix scientific corrections with cosmetic edits, comment changes, or documentation updates in the same commit.

10. **Confirm the active branch before running any script that writes output files.**
    Before running any script that produces output in `out/`, confirm the active branch and verify it is not `master`.

## Known Bugs (identified 2026-02-26) — all resolved on branch `bug-fixes`

> **Branch status (2026-03-04)**: All five bugs are fixed. `R/07b_pnp_RECO.R`
> (rainfall-event P-NP switch for RECO) added and wired into `run_all.R`. Full
> pipeline confirmed running cleanly from raw data. Branch is ready for PI review
> before merging to `master`.

### ~~Bug 1~~ — `R/07_threshold15_RECO.R`: GPPmax mismatch between fitting and prediction — **FIXED** (commit `e7f91c5`)
- **Was**: NP and Pulse models fitted using per-subset GPPmax; predictions used global `All_GPPmax`. Parameters `Fref` and `n` were calibrated under a different normalization than used at prediction time.
- **Fix applied**: removed per-subset `GPPmax_NP_15` / `GPPmax_P_15` columns; changed `m_np` and `m_p` formulas to use `All_meanGPP/All_GPPmax`, consistent with `m_all` and all prediction blocks.

### ~~Bug 2~~ — `R/07_threshold15_RECO.R` lines 55–60: Classification mismatch in `Reco_Combined` — **FIXED** (commit `53be3ef`)
- **Was**: Models are fitted on SWC-threshold splits (`SWC < 15%` vs `SWC ≥ 15%`), but `Reco_Combined` switched using rainfall-event labels (`max_pulse_duration == 0` vs `c(8,14,20)`), with a spurious `MeanM_15` fallback.
- **Fix applied**: replaced `case_when` with `ifelse(All_meanSWC5 >= 0.15, PulseM_15, NonPulseM_15)`; `max_pulse_duration` replaced by `All_meanSWC5` in the `select()`.

### ~~Bug 3~~ — `R/12_13_chamber_models.R` lines 86 & 92: Classification mismatch in `pred_Thr` — **FIXED** (commit `53be3ef`)
- **Was**: NP and Pulse models fitted on rainfall-event-based splits (from `NonPulse_sum_chamber.csv` / `Pulse_sum_chamber.csv`), but `pred_Thr` switched using SWC: `ifelse(meanSWC >= 0.15, pred_P, pred_NP)`.
- **Fix applied**: added `max_pulse_duration` to the `select()` on line 86; changed switch on line 92 to `ifelse(max_pulse_duration > 0, pred_P, pred_NP)`, matching the rainfall-event criterion used in training.

> **Bug 1 verification for `12_13_chamber_models.R`** (confirmed 2026-03-02): Unlike the
> legacy `Chamber model.R`, the refactored script correctly uses a single
> `GPPmax_global = max(df_all$meanGPP)` injected via `mutate(GPPmax = GPPmax_global)`
> inside `fit_one()` before every fit. All three models (All, NP, Pulse) and all
> predictions use the same global scalar. **Bug 1 does not exist in this script.**

### ~~Bug 4~~ — `R/14_Robust_RsoilModels.R`: `cv_year_block_threshold` is not true CV — **FIXED** (commit `d17a0a8`)
- **Was**: The function received pre-computed `pred_NP_all` and `pred_P_all` from models fitted on **all data including the held-out year**. There was data leakage — `cv_Thr` was optimistic and could not be fairly compared to the true leave-one-year-out `cv_All`, `cv_NP`, and `cv_P`.
- **Fix applied**: rewrote `cv_year_block_threshold` to refit the low/high SWC component models on training years inside the loop, then predict the held-out year. Signature changed to accept seed fits and bounds style rather than pre-computed prediction vectors.
- **Note**: with only 4 years of chamber data (2017–2020) the numerical impact is negligible (NLS parameters are stable), but the code is now scientifically correct.

### ~~Bug 5~~ — All model scripts: moisture term can go negative at high SWC — **FIXED** (commit `047c42a`)
- **Was**: `1 - c4×(0.1 - SWC)²` goes negative when `c4 > 1/(SWC - 0.1)²`. With upper bounds of c4=50–200 and pulse-period SWC reaching 0.25–0.35, predictions become physically impossible (negative respiration). No clamp was applied after prediction.
- **Example**: c4=50, SWC=0.25 → moisture term = `1 - 50×0.0225 = −0.125`.
- **Fix applied**: tightened c4 upper bound to 35 (derived from max observed daily-mean SWC of 0.269: `1/(0.269−0.1)² ≈ 35`) and added `pmax(..., 0)` clamp to all prediction vectors as a defensive safeguard. Applied to five scripts: `07_threshold15_RECO.R`, `12_13_chamber_models.R`, `14_Robust_RsoilModels.R`, `12_threshold15_RSOIL.R`, `13_chamber_model.R`.

## Running the Pipeline

**Repository**: https://github.com/davidjpmoore/Fsoil_aridlands

### Getting the code

```bash
# First time
git clone https://github.com/davidjpmoore/Fsoil_aridlands.git
cd Fsoil_aridlands
git checkout bug-fixes

# Already cloned
git fetch origin
git checkout bug-fixes
git pull
```

### Running scripts

Always run from the **project root** (the folder containing `R/` and `data/`). Open `SoilvEcorespiration.Rproj` in RStudio to ensure this automatically.

```r
# Full pipeline
source("R/run_all.R")

# Just the eddy RECO model (script 07 and its dependencies)
source("R/01_read_eddy.R")
source("R/02_define_pulses.R")
source("R/07_threshold15_RECO.R")

# Just the chamber models (scripts 12/13/14 and their dependency)
source("R/08_read_chamber.R")
source("R/12_13_chamber_models.R")
source("R/14_Robust_RsoilModels.R")
```

**Note**: raw data files in `data/` are not in the repo. They must be present locally before running scripts 01 or 08.

## Legacy Script Analysis (completed 2026-03-02)

A detailed review of the four original scripts that produced Tables 2 and 4 revealed
the following. **The legacy manuscript metrics are based on models with Bugs 1 and 2;
the refactored results will differ.**

| Legacy script | Model | Training split | GPPmax: fitting | GPPmax: prediction | Switch criterion | Bugs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Eddy model_2.R` | Mean (RECO) | All days | Global | Global | — | None |
| `Eddy model_2.R` | P-NP Combined (RECO) | Rainfall-event | **Per-subset** | Global | Rainfall-event | Bug 1 |
| `Chamber model.R` | Mean (Rsoil) | All days | Global | Global | — | None |
| `Chamber model.R` | P-NP Combined (Rsoil) | Rainfall-event | **Per-subset** | Global | Rainfall-event | Bug 1 |
| `15% Threshold.R` | 15% Combined (RECO) | SWC-threshold | **Per-subset** | Global | **Rainfall-event** | Bug 1 + Bug 2 |
| `15% for Rsoil.R` | 15% Combined (Rsoil) | SWC-threshold | **Per-subset** | Global | **Rainfall-event** | Bug 1 + Bug 2 |

Key finding: in ALL legacy scripts, NP and Pulse models were fitted with a per-subset
GPPmax (Bug 1). In the threshold scripts, models were trained on SWC splits but the
combined prediction switched on rainfall-event labels (Bug 2). The P-NP scripts
switched on rainfall-event labels consistently with their training — so Bug 2 was
absent there, but Bug 1 was present.

---

## Open Architectural Questions (resolve before further development)

### ~~1. Three-way RECO comparison not yet implemented~~ — **RESOLVED** (2026-03-04)

`R/07b_pnp_RECO.R` was added (commit `79979c3`) and wired into `run_all.R` (line 111).
The three-way RECO comparison is now fully implemented:

| Script | Classification | Switch column | Output |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| `07_threshold15_RECO.R` | SWC ≥ 15% | `Reco_Combined` | `metrics_RECO_15.csv` |
| `07b_pnp_RECO.R` | Rainfall-event | `Reco_PNP` | `metrics_RECO_PNP.csv` |
| Both vs `MeanAll` | All days | `MeanM_*` | both files |

Corrections applied in `07b` vs legacy `Eddy model_2.R`: (a) single global GPPmax used
in fitting and prediction (Bug 1 fix); (b) correct operator precedence `(GPP/GPPmax + n)/(1+n)`.

### 2. Relationship between scripts 12, 13, and 12_13 — **PI decision required**

Three scripts fit Rsoil chamber models:

| Script | Classification | Switch | Status in run_all.R |
|--------|---------------|--------|---------------------|
| `12_threshold15_RSOIL.R` | SWC ≥ 15% | Yes (pred_15) | Not called |
| `13_chamber_model.R` | Rainfall-event | No switch | Not called |
| `12_13_chamber_models.R` | Rainfall-event | Yes (Pred_Threshold) | Called |

`run_all.R` only calls `12_13_chamber_models.R`. The legacy scripts 12 and 13 are
superseded but not deleted. `99_chamber_model_investigation.R` reads outputs from the
legacy 12 and 13 scripts, which are no longer produced by the active pipeline.

Note: `12_13_chamber_models.R` currently produces only the rainfall-event P-NP switch.
It does **not** produce a SWC-threshold switch for Rsoil, which was in the legacy
`15% for Rsoil.R`. For the three-way Rsoil comparison, a SWC-threshold Rsoil model
is also needed.

**PI must decide**: (a) Are scripts 12 and 13 retired? (b) Should `12_13_chamber_models.R`
be extended to also fit and output a SWC-threshold Rsoil switch (mirroring what `07`
does for RECO)? (c) What is the canonical three-way comparison structure for Rsoil?

### 3. Manuscript Table 2/4 numbers will change — **PI should be aware**

Because Bugs 1 and 2 are now fixed in the refactored scripts, all threshold-model
metrics (RMSE, MAPE, R²) will differ from the published/submitted values. The P-NP
model metrics will also shift due to Bug 1 (GPPmax normalization). A full pipeline run
with the complete raw data is required before final numbers can be reported.

---

## Notes & Gotchas

- Run all scripts from the **project root**, not from inside `R/`. Scripts use `if (file.exists("R/00_setup.R"))` to handle both cases.
- SWC in raw data is in **percent (%)**; model fitting requires **fraction [0–1]**. Scripts check `max(SWC) > 1.5` and divide by 100 if needed.
- Missing/fill values: `-9999` and `NaN` are treated as `NA` on read.
- The `12_13_chamber_models.R` script is what `run_all.R` actually calls (not `12_threshold15_RSOIL.R` or `13_chamber_model.R` individually).
- `14_Robust_RsoilModels.R` is the most rigorous modelling script — it adds multi-start optimization (30 starts), year-blocked CV, and threshold grid search.
- Publication figures go to `out/figs/pub/` (scripts 103, 104, 105).
- **All five bugs are resolved** on branch `bug-fixes` (commits `e7f91c5`, `53be3ef`, `d17a0a8`, `047c42a`). The branch is ready for PI review before merging to `master`.
- **`R/07b_pnp_RECO.R` added** (commit `79979c3`) — resolves Architectural Question 1. Pipeline confirmed running cleanly from raw data.
- **Two science/architecture decisions are still pending** (see Open Architectural Questions 2 and 3 above) — do not proceed with new model development until the PI has resolved them.
